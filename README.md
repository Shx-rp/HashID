# HashID
Simple Hash Identifier

## How to use
* Simple! Just open it using
```
python3 hashID.py
```
* or (if you are on linux of course)
```
./hashID.py
```

## How it works
* So this Hash Identifier Works out by taking the value of the hash given and multiplying it by 4 thus giving us the bits on said hash. It then proceeds to compare it against certain lengths defined by this program. It can also Detect Hash Salt/Pass
